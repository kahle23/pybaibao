"""Mojibake detection and restoration for source files.

Handles the most common Chinese-source-file mojibake type:
**UTF-8 bytes were read as GBK/CP936 and re-saved as UTF-8**. This produces
text that looks like garbled CJK (e.g. "鎸囧畾闆嗙兢鍚嶇О") and can be
restored by round-tripping: encode the mojibake text back via GB18030 and
decode as UTF-8.

Why GB18030 (not GBK)?
    GBK cannot encode characters in the PUA (Private Use Area, U+E000-U+F8FF).
    Windows CP936 maps some byte sequences that have no legal GBK double-byte
    representation to PUA code points. GB18030 is a superset of GBK that covers
    all Unicode code points, so it can round-trip these PUA chars back to the
    original UTF-8 bytes.

Algorithm summary:
    1. Split each line into runs of non-ASCII chars (with '?' absorption, since
       trailing 0x3F often marks an isolated byte from the original UTF-8).
    2. For each run containing at least one "weird" char (rare Unicode ranges
       that mojibake artifacts land in), try GB18030-encode + UTF-8-decode.
    3. Accept the restoration if it strictly reduces the "weird" count, yields
       >= 2 consecutive CJK Unified Ideographs, and produces <= 2 U+FFFD.

    from baibao.text.mojibake import scan_file, fix_file, looks_mojibake

    suspicious = scan_file("path/to/File.java")        # detect only
    fixed_count = fix_file("path/to/File.java")        # fix in place
